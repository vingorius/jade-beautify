- [ ] Force/remove comma's , between attributes.
- [ ] Force/remove spaces between attributes.
- [ ] For negated conditions use unless.
- [ ] Use basic pattern for clean escaped string interpolation, e.g. div= value instead of div #{value}.
- [ ] Force space after basic escaped string interpolation, e.g. div= value instead of div=value.
- [ ] Use block expansion for simple nested tags.
- [ ] Self closing tags.
